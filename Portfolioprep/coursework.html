<p> I have taken quite a few classes so far here at bellevue college and reflecting back on them I would say that the most enjoyable classes I took were Japanese. I took four classes before deciding to change my degree from a communications to tech. That being said I still enjoy learning japanese on my own time with Websites such as DuoLingo. </p>
